** DONE [i01] Introduction

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE

SYNOPSIS: =supFunSim= provides a comprehensive simulations framework
for solving the /forward/ and the /inverse/ problems in
electroencephalography (EEG).

   #+END_QUOTE

   =supFunSim= (provided as [[./supFunSim.org][supFunSim.org]] file) contains both ordinary
   human language and /(discrete) computing machine/ code that are
   available in this document in the form of /plain text/.  This text
   tells a story about the reconstruction of neuronal activity
   originating from discrete nodes spread among separate brain
   regions.  This reconstruction is based on the EEG signal.

   First neuronal activity is realistically simulated (we also refer
   to that activity as time series in /source-space/).  The solution
   to a /forward problem/ (FP) is based on (1) the geometry and
   conductivity of head compartments and (2) the position of
   electrodes on the scalp.  This solution allows for generation of
   simulated EEG signals (i.e., time-series in /sensor-space/ that
   result from the activity of neuronal sources).

   Later, sensor-space time-series are used as an input for a variety
   of spatial filtering methods implemented here. This produces
   reconstruction (OR estimation) of the original activity of the
   neuronal sources (i.e., each spatial filter constitutes (OR
   provides) an /inverse problem/ solution).  Next, filtering output
   is compared with the original source-space time-series in order to
   estimate reconstruction errors of a given spatial filter.

   Some of the filters implemented here are known in the literature
   and some are novel generalizations of the aforementioned.  A number
   of parameters is available for manipulation in our simulations
   setup, these are, among others:
   - number of considered sources,
   - signal to noise ratios for a number of noise types (described below).
   We also provide a number of reconstruction error evaluation methods
   (that are relevant for the present neuroscience research).

   Herein we adapt number of solutions provided in toolboxes developed
   by others, namely:
    - [[http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/][FieldTrip]],

   process as we intend to expand it (therefore we are not seeking for
   it to be complete in any near future).

** DOIN [i03] Technicalities
*** Introduction to *GNU Emacs* and =org-mode=

    This document was written using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] in plain text exercising
    advantages of [[http://www.orgmode.org][org-mode]] and [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][(org-)Babel]].  This Emacs mode allows
    for the application of a *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate]]* approach to programming.
    Briefly speaking, the /source code blocks/ are interspersed with
    /ordinary human language blocks/ that provide explanations and
    some insights into governing dynamics and intrinsic mechanics of
    the code.

    =org-mode= allows for easy export of whole documents to HTML,
    \LaTeX, PDF and other formats.  Therefore, various versions of
    this document may also be available, but the plain text version is
    *favorable* for studying the simulations setup (as it provides the
    most interactive encounter with the code).  =org-mode= also allows
    for latex formatted equations, e.g.,

    $e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0$

    GNU Emacs (with =org-mode= and ~Babel~ enabled) provides an
    environment in which this document can be read and at the same
    time the code snippets can be executed (evaluated) within the same
    environment and the code execution results can be incorporated in
    this document as a plain text, figures or in another form
    (provided that, apart from GNU Emacs, the given machine can
    execute [[https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html][MATLAB]] or [[https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/][GNU Octave]] scripts).

    In order to execute all of the simulations steps in a single
    run (or multiple runs) please proceed to the section [[*%5Bs07%5D%20BATCH][BATCH]] (or
    [[*%5Bs08%5D%20LOOP][LOOP]] respectively). Those sections extensively exert on the
    *tangling*, a feature of the =org-mode= that allows for source
    code blocks content to be written to separate files that can be
    later executed (e.g., using MATLAB).

    For this simulations files that are tangled from this
    =org-mode= document are stored in the same [[./][directory]] as the
    =supFunSim.org= file and have names that follow the pattern
    =tg_*=.

    Simulations are hosted on [[https://github.com][GitHub.com]]:

** DONE [s00] Prelude
*** DONE Description

    The following code block prepares MATLAB workspace, adds paths to
    the necessary toolboxes and [[./fun]] directory containing some additional
    functions.  It also loads initial data:
    - head compartments geometry (cortex)
      - [[./mat/sel_msh.mat]]
    - mesh containing candidates for lacation of deep sources (based on thalami)
      - [[./mat/sel_geo_deep_thalami.mat]]
    - mesh containing candidates for lacation of deep sources (based on icosahedron642)
      - [[./mat/sel_geo_deep_icosahedron642.mat]]
    - cortex geometry with (anatomical) ROI parcellation
      - [[./mat/sel_atl.mat]]
    - volume conduction model (head-model)
      - [[./mat/sel_vol.mat]]
    - geometry of electrode positions
      - [[./mat/sel_ele.mat]]

    NB: For the sake of *backward compatibility* and to facilitate
    *bug tracking*, it also provides initial settings for the
    simulations.  Pleas remember that /ut supra/ those settings (most
    likely) need *not to be modified*.  During batch execution of
    simulations initial settings are *overwritten* by values defined
    in sections [[*%5Bs07%5D%20BATCH][BATCH]] and [[*%5Bs08%5D%20LOOP][LOOP]] (the very last sections of this
    document.)

    NB: In the code we make extensive use of a number of acronyms
    and abbreviations, these include:
    - SrcActiv :: Activity of interest (biological)
    - IntNoise :: Interference (biological) noise
    - BcgNoise :: Background (biological) noise
    - MesNoise :: Measurement noise

    We assume that this file is located in (or symbolically linked to)
    [[~/supFunSim]] on machines running GNU with Linux (or any similar
    decent operating system). Similarly the necessary toolboxes are
    expected to be found in sub-directories of the [[~/toolboxes]]
    directory (or symlinked there). Otherwise the following code might
    need to be adjusted (e.g., by changing value of the =TMP_TBX_PATH=
    variable etc.)  Some additional necessary functions are located in
    the [[./fun]] directory.

    Simulation parameters are controlled using =SETUP= variable.  The
    geometrical arrangement and number of cortical sources in ROIs can
    be controlled using =SRCS= field (=SETUP.SRCS=), which is a 3
    column ~<int>~ array.
    - *Rows* of =SETUP.SRCS= reppresent consequent ROIs.
    - *Cols* of =SETUP.SRCS= represent signal types, namely:
      - ~SrcActiv~,
      - ~IntNoise~ and
      - ~BcgNoise~,
      respectively.
    - Integers represent a number of sources in the given ROI for the
      given signal type.

    Variable =SETUP= also contains field =DEEP= (=SETUP.DEEP=) which
    defines number of signals in the brain center (around thalami) that
    belong to particular signal type (same as for cortical signal types
    these include: ~SrcActiv~, ~IntNoise~ and ~BcgNoise~).

*** MVAR modeling for bioelectrical activity sources
**** Info

     In this section multivariate timeseries are generated for:
     =sim_sig_SrcActiv=, =sim_sig_IntNoise=, =sim_sig_BcgNoise=.

     Timeseries are based on Multivariate Autoregressive (MVAR) model.

     ${{v}_{\nu}}=w+\underset{l=1}{\overset{p}{\mathop \sum }}\,{{A}_{l}}{{v}_{\nu-l}}+{{\varepsilon}_{\nu}}$, where

     - ${{v}_{\nu}}$ are the $m$-dimensional state vectors of (stationary)
       time series,

     - $p$ is the order of the model,

     - matrices ${{A}_{1}}\ldots{{A}_{p}} \in R^{m\times{}m}$ are the
       coefficient matrices of the AR model,

     - ${{\varepsilon}_{\nu}}$ are the $m$-dimensional uncorrelated
       random vectors with mean zero and covariance matrix $C \in
       R^{m\times{}m}$

****** Normalized frequency

       See
       - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_frequency_(unit)][Wiki: EN: Normalized frequency (unit)]]
       - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_frequency_%2528unit%2529#Alternative_normalizations][Wiki: EN: Normalized frequency (unit): Alternative normalizations]]
         - Some programs (such as MATLAB) that design filters with
           real-valued coefficients use the Nyquist frequency
           ($\textstyle f_s/2$) as the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalizing_constant][normalization constant]].  The
           resultant normalized frequency has units of
           /half-cycles/sample/ or equivalently /cycles per 2 samples/.
         - Sometimes, the unnormalized frequency is represented in units
           of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian_per_second][radians/second]] ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_frequency][angular frequency]]),
           and denoted by $\textstyle \omega$. When
           $\textstyle \omega$ is normalized by the
           sample-rate (/samples/sec/), the resulting units are
           /radians/sample/.  The normalized Nyquist frequency is
           π /radians/sample/, and the normalized sample-rate is
           2π /radians/sample/.
         - The following table shows examples of normalized frequencies
           for a 1 kHz signal, a sample rate $\textstyle
           f_\mathrm{s}$ = [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/44,100_Hz][44.1 kHz]], and 3 different choices of
           normalized units.  Also shown is the frequency region
           containing one cycle of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-time_Fourier_transform][discrete-time Fourier transform]],
           which is always a periodic function.

    NOTE 1: The following procedure is applied to the orientation vectors of activity sources:
    in order to achieve their random perturbation:
    1. Original orientations are vertex vormal vectors of the triangulation mesh;
    2. Coordinates are transformed to spherical;
    3. =SETUP.CONE= is the max perturbation (angle of max rotation) considered
    4. Multiplied here by random number \in [-1,1];
    5. Azimuth [TH] and elevation [PHI] are modified by adding the above random numbers;
    6. Radius is not changed (the added matrix has last column padded with zeros);
    7. Coordinates are transformed back to the cartesian system.

** OPEN [z02] Remarks and observations
*** OPEN General

    - Principal sub-matrices in MVAR model are reconstructed quite
      robustly from IntNoise signal (that may have lowered dimensionality)
      when compared with SigIn
    - The above also aplies to PDC

*** OPEN Open questions

    - [ ] przy ustalonym poziomie interferencji i szumu tła, zmieniając poziom
    szumu measurement, wydajność filtrów ładnie rośnie wraz ze spadkiem
    szumu - expected behaviour; natomiast przy ustalonym poziomie
    interferencji i szumu measurement, zmieniając poziom szumu tła,
    wydajność filtrów nie zależy praktycznie od SBNR - czy dobrze ustawiamy
    poziomy szumu?

    - [ ] przy niskiej interferncji SINR=20 dB filtry sMVP_NL_XXX kilujące
    interferencję dalej sobie bdb radzą - czyżbyśmy byli genialni, a może
    coś z ustawieniami poziomu szumu nie funga?

    - [ ] krótka długość sygnału nie zabija MMSE, a powinna - z czego
    estymujemy macierze kowariancji? Jutro sobie wyjaśnijmy?

    - [ ] ustawienie
    SETUP.n00    = 500;     % number of time samples per trial
    SETUP.K00    = 1;      % number of independent realizations of signal and noise based on generated MVAR model

    powoduje generację błędu - czy chodzi o brak możliwości dopasowania modelu MVAR? Jeżeli tak, czy można zrobić
    wersję "activity reconstruction only", bez dopasowania PDC odtworzonych sygnałów?

*** OPEN Theory <-> Practice tests

    NB: Udaje się już zejść do realizacji r=1 i długości sygnału s=200 (do s=100
    nie, arfit generuje błąd "too short time series", co jest zrozumiałe).

**** Measurement noise

     1. Tylko measurement noise, SMNR = 20, r=50, s=500 (długi sygnał,
     powtórzony wiele razy)
     :: OK (b. małe błędy filtrów)

     2. Tylko measurement noise, SMNR = 20, r=1, s=200 (krótki sygnał, powtórzony raz)
     :: OK (małe błędy filtrów zależnych od N (można wyestymować łatwo, tylko
     biały szum), większe zależnych od R (wyestymować trudniej, sygnał nie
     jest biały))

     3. Tylko measurement noise, SMNR = 0, r=50, s=500
     :: OK (błędy większe niż w przypadku 1., ale porównywalne pomiędzy
     filtrami używającymi R i N, MMSE bdb)

     4. Tylko measurement noise, SMNR = 0, r=1, s=200
     :: OK (błędy porównywalne pomiędzy filtrami używającymi R i N, MMSE
     gorzej, filtry EIG dobrze)

     PODSUMOWANIE: ZACHOWANIE DLA MEASUREMENT NOISE ZGODNE Z TEORIĄ

**** Biological noise

     1. Tylko biological noise, SBNR = 20, r=50, s=500 (długi sygnał,
     powtórzony wiele razy)
     :: NIE-OK (gargantuiczny błąd MMSE, LCMV_N, wybierane rzędy sMVPxx bardzo
     niskie, tylko LCMV_R wygląda sensownie - bardzo mały błąd). OCZEKIWANE
     ZACHOWANIE: bardzo małe błędy wszystkich filtrów (sygnał 1000 mocniejszy od szumu
     tła, bardzo długi sygnał do wyestymowania R i N).
